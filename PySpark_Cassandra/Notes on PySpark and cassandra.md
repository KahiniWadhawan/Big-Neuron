##py-spark and cassandra.  

I installed a binary version of spark (followed some tutorial for learning spark) however it seems the 1.4 version is buggy and not compatible with cassandra. 
So, avoid using ver 1.4 of spark. But if anyone of you managed to solve it and let's discuss it in the next meeting.
