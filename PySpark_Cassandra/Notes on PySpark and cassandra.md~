##py-spark and cassandra.  

I installed a binary version of spark (followed some tutorial for learning spark) however it seems the 1.4 version is buggy and not compatible with cassandra. 
So, avoid using ver 1.4 of spark. But if anyone of you managed to solve it please let me know :)

Will resume working on improving the accuracy on the sentiment analysis.
Currently, i am reinstalling spark with cassandra ().
