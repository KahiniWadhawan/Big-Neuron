### Project Objective:

**[ELECTIONITICS](http://electionitics.press)** is an interactive web application that allows the user to visualize Twitter Big Data in an easy to understand and appealing manner.  The data visualized is specifically focused on the 2016 presidential race.  **Electionitics** shows the user what the nation is feeling regarding each candidate through Twitter and Tweet-level sentiment analysis.  It provides visualizations for each candidate's follower network as well as Twitter data topic modeling per candidate.
