### Project Objective:

**[ELECTIONITICS](http://electionitics.press)** is an interactive web application that allows the user to visualize Twitter Big Data in an easy to understand and appealing manner.  The data visualized is specifically focused on the 2016 presidential race.  **Electionitics** shows the user what the nation is feeling regarding each candidate through Twitter and Tweet-level sentiment analysis.  It provides visualizations for each candidate's follower network as well as Twitter data topic modeling per candidate.

### Team Members:  

Big Neuron's **[ELECTIONITICS](http://electionitics.press)** was created by and is maintained by **Tanvi Parikh** and **Jessica Lynch** along with their teammates who created and maintain the backend systems of our big data pipeline: **Piyush Sudip Patel**, **Kahini Wadhawan** and **Michael D. Muehlbradt**.
